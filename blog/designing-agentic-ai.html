                <p>The internet is flooded with "Build an Autonomous Agent in 5 minutes" tutorials. They usually involve
                    a simple loop where an LLM picks a tool, runs it, and repeats. It works great for a demo where you
                    ask "What is the weather in Tokyo?".</p>

                <p>It fails catastrophically when you ask it to "Process these 500 invoices and reconcile them with the
                    ERP system, but ask for human approval if the variance is > $1000".</p>

                <p>In this post, I want to discuss the architecture required to move agentic AI from a toy to a
                    production-grade system.</p>

                <h2>1. State Management is Everything</h2>
                <p>The biggest mistake in naive agent implementations is implicit state. Most frameworks treat the
                    "message history" as the state. This is insufficient for complex workflows.</p>

                <p>In production, you need <strong>explicit, structured state</strong>. We don't just pass strings back
                    and forth; we pass a State Object that defines exactly where we are in the process.</p>

                <pre><code>class WorkflowState(BaseModel):
    current_step: str
    reconciliation_status: dict[str, str]
    human_approval_required: bool = False
    retry_count: int = 0
    artifacts: List[str] = []</code></pre>

                <p>By treating the agent's memory as a database record rather than a chat log, we gain observability,
                    resumability, and debuggability.</p>

                <h2>2. Deterministic Routing > "Intelligent" routing</h2>
                <p>We often overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for control flow. Relying on an LLM to
                    decide <em>every</em> single next step is a recipe for non-deterministic chaos.</p>

                <p>Instead, use LLMs only for the "fuzzy" decisions, and use code for the hard rules. If the invoice
                    amount is > $1000, <strong>code</strong> should trigger the approval workflow, not the LLM. The LLM
                    should be used to extract the invoice amount, but the routing logic should be deterministic
                    Python/Go code.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Constraint is the mother of reliability. Restrict the agent's action space at every step."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>3. The "Human-in-the-Loop" Pattern</h2>
                <p>Agents will get stuck. They will hallucinate tool arguments. They will encounter API errors.</p>

                <p>A production system must have a "suspension" protocol. When an agent hits a critical failure or a
                    high-stakes decision, it should serialize its state to a database and emit an event. A human
                    operator can then view the state, correct a variable, and "resume" the agent.</p>

                <p>This requires your architecture to be asynchronous and event-driven, rather than a simple synchronous
                    `while` loop.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Building agents is easy. Building reliable agents is an exercise in distributed systems engineering,
                    state machine design, and rigorous evaluation. The LLM is just a component, not the architect.</p>
